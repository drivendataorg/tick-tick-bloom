    "# Modeling Notes for algae bloom competition\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Andrew Wheeler](mailto:apwheele@gmail.com), [Personal Blog to see my work](https://andrewpwheeler.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are my notes for the data competition, [Tick Tick Bloom: Harmful Algal Bloom Detection Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/143/tick-tick-bloom/page/649/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a high level, I ensemble three different boosted models in the final solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - xgboost with fields `region, cluster, date`\n",
    "  - catboost with fields `region, cluster, date, latitude, longitude, maxe, dife`\n",
    "  - lightboost with fields `region, cluster, imtype, date, latitude, longitude , elevation ,dife, imtype, prop_lake_2500, r_2500, g_2500, b_2500, prop_lake_1000, r_1000, g_1000, b_1000`\n",
    "\n",
    "For a description of the variable fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - region: metadata given region of US\n",
    "  - cluster: arbitrary binning of lat/lon into different clusters (based on looking at distribution of lat/lon)\n",
    "  - date: date field for event, the models under the hood turn these into features of days since 1/1/2015, day of the week, and month of the year (experimented with year as well, but not in final model)\n",
    "  - latitude: given via metadata\n",
    "  - latitude: given via metadata\n",
    "  - maxe: maximum elevation within 1000 meters of lat/lon (from DEM)\n",
    "  - dife: difference in min/max elevation of 1000 meters (from DEM)\n",
    "  - elevation: elevation at exact lat/lon (from DEM)\n",
    "  - imtype: image type (ended up only using Sentinel images, filtered out landsat entirely)\n",
    "  - prop_lake_2500: Estimate of water area at 2500 meters from lat/lon\n",
    "  - r_2500: estimate of red inside water area at 2500 meters\n",
    "  - g_2500: estimate of green inside water area at 2500 meters\n",
    "  - b_2500: estimate of blue inside water area at 2500 meters\n",
    "  - prop_lake_1000: Estimate of water area at 1000 meters from lat/lon\n",
    "  - r_1000: estimate of red inside water area at 1000 meters\n",
    "  - g_1000: estimate of green inside water area at 1000 meters\n",
    "  - b_1000: estimate of blue inside water area at 1000 meters \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the competition, I started with each individual model, doing slight hyper-parameter tuning and seeing the optimal results on the leaderboad. Then I additionally tinkered with the final results (minor things, like tweaking the iterations and the depth of the trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not bother to download the weather data (just to download the satellite data was quite a chore). For future competitions I would suggest DataDriven provide a set of already produced functions, so it is easier for participants to understand what data is valid, and make it easier for people to participate. While I imagine weather data would improve the results, I did not have time to fully understand that data and incorporate it into my model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note, given the error metric is mean-squared-error, I use a regression models, not multinomial. I then predict a continuous outcome, and then round/clip to the nearest integer value. For the ensemble models, I take a simple average of the not rounded values, and then round the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the satellite imagery, I used [k-means image segmentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d1/d5c/tutorial_py_kmeans_opencv.html) to try to identify water areas (I doubt this works very well, the other model features did most of the work), and then calculate the R/G/B stats, as well as the size of the water area. The final models I chose within 1000 meters and 2500 meters doing this, but also tested within 500 meters as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially made a mistake, and used sentinel data + landsat-7. The solution on 2/6 (private score 0.7580) incorrectly used the landsat-7 data. So my 2nd best solution on 2/16 (private score 0.7616) is what I illustrate here.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a stupid mistake and I apologize. For those wishing to replicate the same results but with LandSat-8 data, you just need to change 1 character in `src/sat_fe.py` on line 89.\n",
    "\n",
    "**END NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it would be better to just use [NOAA's list of lakes to filter the imagery](https://community.drivendata.org/t/outside-data-sources/8325/2), but that was against the competition rules. (Smaller lakes have higher concentrations.) Also this model will be bad if you submit somewhere with no lake to begin with (it will spit out numbers, but obviously they should be no risk of bloom). Using the lakes data would limit where it makes sense to even make predictions."
