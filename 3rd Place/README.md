# Tick Tick Bloom: Harmful Algal Bloom Detection Challenge

Install anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com) and
`cd` to this directory and create a conda environment

`conda env create -n algae-bloom --file environment.yml`

Activate the environment

`conda activate algae-bloom`

Run [main.ipynb](./main.ipynb) to train and generate predictions. Alternatively, you may run the commands in the notebook from the terminal.

I've included links to download the processed data and pretrained models so you may skip the preprocessing steps and directly run the training/inference scripts.
